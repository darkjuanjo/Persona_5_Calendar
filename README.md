# Persona 5 Style Calendar for Ubersicht 

All the calendar data is stored in an object named Calendar.
Inside Calendar you can set the display language of to either English or Japanese.
Display_Type is used to specify if you want the calendar fully in Japanese or only Half.
Half only changes the Day of the week while Full affects every items except alerts.
Note that you need to provide your own openweather key in order for the weather to work.

Widget is draggable so feel free to move it anywhere, however widget will reset to the
default position if widget is reloaded.

If you click the weather icon (*note not the white) it will open openweather with your city
information.

For any changes you do makes sure to refresh all widgets. Otherwise timers starts adding up.
